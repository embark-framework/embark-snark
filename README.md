Embark-Snark
======

Plugin for [Embark](https://github.com/embark-framework/embark) to compile circom circuits and generate solidity proof

Installation
======

In your embark dapp directory:
```npm install embark-snark --save```

then add embark-snark to the plugins section in ```embark.json```:

```Json
  "plugins": {
    "embark-snark": {
      "circuits": ["app/circuits/**"],
      "inputs": {
        "multiplier": {
          "a": 3,
          "b": 11
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

You can defined where your circuits will be and what are the inputs.

Now you can create your first circuits, for example, ```app/circuits/multiplier.circom```:

```
  template Multiplier() {
    signal private input a;
    signal private input b;
    signal output c; c <== a*b;
  }

  component main = Multiplier();
```

Embark will now compile the circuits and generate a solidity contracts to verify the proof as well as deploy it.

Requirements
======

- Embark 4.0.0 or higher
